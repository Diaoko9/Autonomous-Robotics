<p>Dear Students,</p><p>Here, I very quickly want to talk about two different solvers. In this course, since we work in Python, then the solver that is used for the optimization problem is qpsolvers. However, if you work in Matlab, then you will probably end up using quadprog.</p><p>They work exactly in the same way. If your goal is to find a solution that minimizes your cost function and takes into account the constraints, then you would use them as follows:</p><p>du_g=solve_qp(Hdb,f^T,G,h^T)</p><p>du_g=quadprog(Hdb,f^T,G,h^T)</p><p>However, there are 3 differences between them that I want to mention:</p><p><br></p><p>a) In quadprog, the 2nd and 4th inputs can be both, row and column vectors. Thus, you can write them either in this way:</p><p><strong>du_g=quadprog(Hdb,f^T,G,h^T)</strong> </p><p>or in this way:</p><p><strong>du_g=quadprog(Hdb,f,G,h)</strong></p><p>So you can skip transposing them. Qpsolvers only accepts those inputs as row vectors:</p><p><strong>du_g=solve_qp(Hdb,f^T,G,h^T)</strong></p><p>So, quadprog, in this way, it is more flexible.</p><p><br></p><p>b) The solution <strong>du_g</strong> that is found using qpsolvers is delivered as a row vector. Quadprog however brings that solution, <strong>du_g</strong>, to you as a column vector.</p><p><br></p><p>c) In Python, when you use qpsolvers (<strong>du_g=solve_qp(Hdb,f^T,G,h^T)</strong>), then it is very important that all the 4 inputs there contain numbers, that are floats. That means that every number has to be accompanied by a point. So, for example, if Hdb is an identity matrix that you create manually, then it is important that you write it as follows:</p><p><strong>Hdb=[1. 0.;0. 1.]</strong> </p><p>and not: </p><p><strong>Hdb=[1 0;0 1]</strong></p><p>Note that I put a point after a number in order to enforce that the numbers in Python are floats and not integers. That applies to the inputs: <strong>f^T, G, h^T </strong>as well. In this course it is not a problem, because the simulator produces those inputs that are already floats. However, in the future, if you create those inputs manually, then please keep that in mind.</p><p>In Matlab however, you should simply write those numbers without points and it will work fine.</p><p><br></p><p>These are the general extra recommendations in order to avoid that you would get stuck because of those little things.</p><p>Best Regards,</p><p>Mark Misin</p>
